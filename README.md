# NIRP
This repository contains Stata scripts that were developed and used for the analyses carried out under the NIRP (Italian Network for Research on Psychoses) project.

Specifically, it currently contains the SLOFconc.ado script that was used for the analyses described in the paper "Accuracy of self-assessment of real-life functioning in schizophrenia: evidence from the Italian Network for Research on Psychoses" soon to be published on nrp Schizophrenia.

The script is a Stata .ado file than can be run without arguments. However, those who want to utilize the script must modify the paths where data files are saved on their PCs and check steps a., b., c., e. and f. as they were needed only because of the data flow established in the NIRP project.
